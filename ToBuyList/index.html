    <h1>To-Buy-List</h1>
    <p>This is my first full stack project. This is an app which I need for a certain requirement in my household. We
        often go to the nearby town to buy groceries and other stuff. However, we make the grocery list when we are
        about to head to the town and we often forget a thing or two that must be bought. So, I created this live
        grocery list. This is a live version of the piece of paper that you take when you are heading to the market.
        When you remember that you need to buy something, you can add that item to the To-Buy-List. Then, after you go
        to the market, you can add the price of the item that you bought, and add the same item to the expenses list.
        This is a simple software and as it is my first project I did not bother to include certain features like delete
        buttons. But, this is a software which has a utility value. The link to the deployment is given below. The
        software maybe a bit slow as it has been deployed on a free version of render.</p>
