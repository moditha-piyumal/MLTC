    <h1>Bed-Time-Story-Teller</h1>
    <p>You have to download the index.html file , the style.css file and the script.js file in order to make this work.
        After downloading them into a folder, open the index.html with your browser. You will be able to load video
        files. You can then watch them. You will be asked to press the continue button every 20 minutes to see if you
        have fallen asleep. If you have fallen asleep the video will stay paused and a new timestamp will be created at
        a moment which is two minutes from the place where you clicked continue. You can load the progress of a video
        after closing the browser by loading the video first and then loading the progress next. This can be done only
        if you have saved the progress in a json file with the save progress button.</p>
    <a href="index.html">Go to the Software here. This will work when downloaded.</a>
